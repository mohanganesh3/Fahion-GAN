# Fashion-GAN 👗🖼️

The Fashion-GAN project enables you to build your very own Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate new synthetic datasets. This repository provides a comprehensive guide on implementing a GAN architecture specifically tailored for fashion-related data.

# 🚀 Key Features

	•	Generative Adversarial Network: Learn how GANs work by implementing the generator and discriminator models.
	•	Synthetic Dataset Generation: Generate new fashion images that resemble your training dataset.
	•	Hands-On Implementation: Follow along with the Jupyter notebook (FashionGAN.ipynb) for practical insights into the GAN training process.

# 🧠 How It Works

	1.	Understanding GANs:
	•	A GAN consists of two neural networks: the generator and the discriminator. The generator creates synthetic images, while the discriminator evaluates their authenticity.
	2.	Training the Model:
	•	The model is trained through adversarial processes where the generator aims to produce images that the discriminator cannot distinguish from real ones.
	3.	Generating Synthetic Data:
	•	Once trained, the GAN can generate new fashion images based on the learned patterns from the training dataset.

# 🔧 Usage

	1.	Jupyter Notebook:
	•	Run FashionGAN.ipynb to follow the implementation and generate synthetic datasets.
